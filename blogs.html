            <p class="blog-paragraph">After months of negotiation and debate, the U.S. House of Representatives could be
                poised to pass a two-part legislative package aimed at overhauling the country’s notoriously aging
                infrastructure. But House Democrats (who hold a majority in the chamber) have yet to reach an agreement
                on
                one part: a bill that focuses on social progr....</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph">In the midst of a conversation with an acquaintance, your brain might skip ahead, anticipating the words that the other person will say. Perhaps then you will blurt out whatever comes to mind. Or maybe you will nurse your guess quietly, waiting to see if—out of all the hundreds of thousands of possibilities—your conversational......</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">Lou Gehrig was a star baseball player who led the New York Yankees to six World Series titles before he was diagnosed with a devastating disease in 1939, when he was still in his mid-30s. The disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes the motor neurons that enable muscle movement to deteriorate, gradually leading to the loss of the ability to move, eat, speak and even breathe. Gehrig’s illness, which had already been documented for decades, hel....</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph">How much time do you spend doing research before you make a decision? The answer for many of us, it turns out, is “hardly any,” even with major investments. Most people make two trips or fewer to a dealership before buying a car. And according to survey results in a 2003 paper by economist Katherine Harris, when picking a doctor, many individ...</p>
